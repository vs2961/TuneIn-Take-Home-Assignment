# TuneIn-Take-Home-Assignment

Written for TuneIn's Take Home Assignment.
I will make this repo private once my process with TuneIn is completed.

## Notes

All the code you need is found in `performance.py`.

However, in order to run this script, you will need to create a `.env` file. This is because I learned the hard way that I can't push
webhook links onto github, or Slack will disable it. I wouldn't want that happening to your webhook!

Example `.env` file:
```
WEBHOOK_URL = "[YOUR WEBHOOK HERE]"
```
